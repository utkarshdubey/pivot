# pivot
Use pivot üêç to create fast &amp; unobtrusive interface for your updates or changelog bulletin.

### packages used
we're using quite a lot of open-source projects, thanks to all of them:

* [Express]
* [Dotenv]
* [Method Override]
* [Mongoose]
* [Body-parser]

And of course pivot itself is open source with a [public repository](#pivot)
 on GitHub.
**We are using MongoDB for the database.**

### Installation

pivot requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v7+ to run.

You'd also need to create a ``.env`` file with the required [variables](#env).

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd pivot
$ yarn
$ node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ yarn
```
Delete the Environment variable `DEVELOPMENT`, instead of setting it to `false`. Also set `PRODUCTION_DB_URI` to your remote MongoDB URL.

### Routes
Here are the following routes that are available:

#### GET /changelog
Fetches all the available changlog entries in the descending order of their date/time created.

#### GET /changelog/:reference
Fetches all the available changlog entries for a given reference.

#### GET /changelog/delete/:id
Deletes the specified changlog entry for a given id. Also known as the `_id` in MongoDB.

#### POST /changelog/add
Adds a new changlog entry to the list of available changlog entries. The following fields are required to add a new changelog:
| Field | Description | Required |

| details | Details and the actual changelog. | Yes |
| reference | Reference code for finding(tags) | Yes |

| Variable Name | Value |
